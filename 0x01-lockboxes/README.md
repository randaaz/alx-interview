# Lockboxes

This project involves solving a problem related to lockboxes using Python. To effectively tackle this project, it's essential to have a solid understanding of various key concepts in Python programming and algorithms. Below are the details and resources that will be instrumental in successfully completing this project:

#### Key Concepts Needed:

1. **Lists and List Manipulation**: Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically, is crucial. Refer to the [Python Lists documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) for detailed information.

2. **Graph Theory Basics**: Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory can be beneficial, especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search. Graph theory concepts are applicable as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph. You can learn more about Graph Theory on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms).

3. **Algorithmic Complexity**: Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important for writing efficient algorithms. Get familiar with Big O Notation through resources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/big-o-notation/).

4. **Recursion**: Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys. Learn about recursion in Python from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/).

5. **Queue and Stack**: Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes. Understand Python Queue and Stack implementations from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/).

6. **Set Operations**: Utilizing sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process. Familiarize yourself with Python Sets through the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets).

#### Requirements:

- **General**:
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should be documented
  - Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
  - All your files must be executable

#### Tasks:

1. **Lockboxes**:
   - Prototype: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`
   - `boxes` is a list of lists
   - A key with the same number as a box opens that box
   - You can assume all keys will be positive integers
   - There can be keys that do not have boxes
   - The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked
   - Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`
